x = 9

x = math.sqrt(x)
# finds the square root of x's value

print(x)
# prints it

x = math.ceil(x)
# .ceil(x) rounds up to the nearest integer
# like if 4.5 turns into 5

# .floor(x) rounds down to the nearest integer
# like if 4.5 turns into 4

x = 9

y = 2

x = math.pow(x,y)
# raise x to the power y.
# meaning 9^2.

print(x)
# prints it as float.

x = math.pi
# stores or returns the value of pi
